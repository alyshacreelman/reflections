This article discusses the issue of generative AI models (in this cas Stable Diffusion) implementing harmful racial and gender stereotypes into thier image generation.
This can have extreme negative effects on society as AI is used in more cases, "further perpetuating stereotypes that threaten to stall progress toward greater equality 
in representation and potentially resulting in unfiar treatment.

For this study, researchers "prompted the text-to-image model to create representations of workers for 14 jobs — 300 images each for seven jobs that are typically considered 
“high-paying” in the US and seven that are considered “low-paying.” The results, shown in the data visualization below, show the shocking results.

After showing each of the images generated by the AI, the visualization changes each of these images into a box with the color of the generated person's skin tone.
When the the reader keeps scrolling, each of these boxes is then organized into groups under the job title the image was generated for. This clearly shows that
that the race of the workers is not even close to being evenly distributed under each job title.

The boxes then change color and are quickly reorganized to show the gender breakdown of each image generated under each job title. Showing gender inequality.

At the end of the visualization, the researchers also provide the "average" person generated for each of the job titles, which is done by finding the average
color and position of each pixel.

My reflection of this visualization: I found this data visualization to be extremely creative, engaging, and impactful. I think the visualization uses the data
as a tool to clearly display the biases that this generative AI model had, which was the goal of the article. The animations of each data point encourage the reader
to continue scrolling through the article and ensure that not too much information is displayed on the screen at once. Starting with each data point as the original
generated image was also a great way to help the reader understand what the article is discussing, as some readers may be less familiar with AI and thier abilities.
I also loved how the visualization animated the images changes to the skin color associated with it in the study, as this helped show the process of the researchers
in converting each image to one color. Each job category and skin color is also clearly defined, making the visualization easy for the reader to understand. I also
really like the way that this visualization transitions from quantitative to qualitative data. In the beginning of the animation, each box represents
each individual image generated, showing each breakdown. At the end, each of these groups of little colored boxes is morphed into an image of the "average" person
generated under the job position, leaving the reader with a better understanding of the AI's images.
