For this week's reflection, I wanted to share my favorite visualization that I found while doing research on climate change data vis. One of the biggest issues that
journalists face when discussing climate change is that while the audience recognizes that climate change is an issue, they do not think that this issue will ever
impact them directly. In this visualization created by Nadja Popovich, Blacki Migliozzi, Rumsey Taylor, Josh Williams, and Derek Watkins, the audience is able to
see how increases in temperature as a result of climate change are predicted to impact their hometown in their lifetime. As shown in the image below, the user is 
prompted to input their hometown and year of birth when first encountering the visualization.

Once the location and year have been inputted, a line graph appears showing the expected number of hot days (in this case about 90 degrees) in the year you were born, 
currently, and by the time you are 80 years old. Text appearing on the screen helps you to interpret this graph by telling you the expected number of hot days
as well as the possible range. The data used to create this graphic was obviously extremely rich, containing data for many specific locations. I think that the ability
to input your specific birth year and town is very powerful for the reader to begin to understand that climate change is everyone's issue. A measurement such 
as "number of days over 90 degrees" is a great way to show people the changes in the world around them because we can all remember days when it was over 90 degrees
and imagine what it would be like if the number of days at that temperature tripled. I think that a line graph is also a great way to represent this data despite its
simplicity. The line allows the user to estimate the average number of days for a particular decade on the x axis while also getting an idea of the upward
trend in the line. I also think that the way of representing uncertainty by shading an area around the graph is also very intuitive. When making predictions for 
temperature 60 years in the future, there is guarenteed to be a high level of uncertainty. While adding uncertainty can complicate a graph, I think it is necessary
in this type of situation to add legitamacy.

There are a few additions I would make to this graph to potentially enhace the user experience. First, I think that the y-axis label could be moved to the left side
of the graph. Though I see the purpose of its current position, I think there can be power in keeping a visualization like this as "standard" as possible in order to 
not confuse the reader. I also think that having axis titles could be beneficial to the reader, although it would make the graph less simplistic. Additionally,
I think adding a tooltip that would allow users to hover over the graph and see the prediction for a certain year could be a way to keep users engaged
with the graphic for longer. For example, they could wonder "What will the temperature look like when I am 40 and may have children of my own?" In the graph's current
state, the x axis is marked every 10 years, making it a bit difficult to see predictions for specific years.

I would also like to add that I think the map visualization at the end (pictured below) is a great way to put the user's home in context with the rest of the world.
While temperature changes in some areas (such as my home in Auburn) may not be very drastic, other parts of the world with extreme weather and heat are going 
to see much more damaging changes over the course of the user's lifetime, which is important to recognize. The color-coded map visual, with darker colors 
resembling more extreme temperature increases, is a very intuitive way of showing climate change around the world. Overall, I think that this entire article is a very 
important piece of climate change journalism that will have a lasting impact on its readers.
