In an article titled "Why are so many babies born around 8:00 A.M?" data visualization engineer Zan Armstrong visualizes data about the birth times of babies from
the CDC in 2014 in the United States to help the reader understand trends in birth rates. The snapshot of the visualization below shows a circle representing 24 hours of the day. The 
yellow ring in this visualization represents the average number of babies born per minute in the US (7.3 babies), while red spikes indicate above average values
and blue dips represent below average values. I was drawn to this visualization because I felt that it was a very intelligent way to represent the data and is more 
unique than traditional representations of contiuous time data such as scatterplots. Representing
time data over the course of 24 hours is unique in the sense that it repeats on a cycle. This makes the circle a great way to represent this data because when you 
reach the "end" of the day at 11:59 PM, you can just continue on the circle right back to the beginning. As humans, we are also very used to seeing time in this way 
when looking at clocks, which can help make the visualization more intuitive. I think the creator makes great use of color here, playing into the "dark is more" bias
by adding a color gradient. I think having red represent the spikes in birth rate makes sense in this case, as the red is more attention grabbing and helps the 
reader understand the main point of the article (explaining why there are spikes at times like 8:00 AM). For me, red is associated with hot/ higher values while
blue is associated with cool/ lower values, which allowed me to understand this visualization quicker. I also think that the legend is fairly simple to understand, 
though the label showing what 25% more/ less looks like can be a bit difficult to understand when looking at the actual graph. The annotations added onto the visualization
are also a great way for the reader to get some information about this visualization without having to read the entire article. For example, the annotation "**Boom** 
The morning peak is driven by planned C-sections" helps the reader understand what these spikes represent even before reading the legend.

One thing that I love about this visualization and article is how the creator places emphasis on telling the full story and not misleading the reader. With data and 
colorful graphs like this, it would be very easy for the creator to leave the reader thinking that there are random spikes in birth times just due to chance. Instead
of trying to hook the reader with some crazy ideas, the creator makes it clear in the first graph why we are seeing such fluxuations in birth times. The creator
even added a fun tip to one of the visualizations noting that "more babies than average are born on weekdays during daylight hours. Fewer are born on weekends or at night, 
primarily because fewer hospital staffers are on duty, so women tend not to schedule their delivery then. Despite folklore, a full moon has no effect." As shown in the
image below, the reader is also provided with a more detailed breakdown of birth time by delivery type, allowing the reader to fully understand why there would
be spikes in something like birth time that is generally thought to be random and unplanned.

One way that I think the visualization could be imporved is to make the additional rings in the first graph representing 9 births and 6 births more obvious. I think that 
these labels are important, as seeing huge spikes in the graph can be misleading and potentially makes people think that the data is fluctuating more than it really is.
I think a way to make these stand out a bit more would be to make the time labels that go around the circle black while keeping the additional rings gray. This way,
they would not blend in with the time labels as easily because they would be different colors. Alternatively, the creator could get rid of these additonal rings
and add some more annotations to the visual (an arrow with the number of babies per minute that a specific peak or dip represents).
